What is the best time complexity to insert a new element in an 
unordered linked list?

1. O(n^2)
2. O(log n)
3. O(1) this?
4. O(n)

Given the head of an ordered linked list and a new value, 
what is the worst-case time complexity to insert the new node 
while preserving the ordering?

1. O(log n)
2. O(1)
3. O(n^2)
4. O(n)


What is the worst time complexity to access a specific element in a linked list?

1. O(1)
2. O(log n)
3. O(n^2)
4. O(n)

The last node in a list is indicated by:

1. A node missing a next pointer/reference
2. A node with the next field set to null (none or undefined) this
3. The node type is TailNode
4. The index is one less than the length of the list
